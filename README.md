### What is sconelib? ###

* Sconelib (current version 0.0.1-alpha) is a simple collection of utility classes that I frequently use
* for HaxePunk development. Currently, it's very bare-bones and mostly for personal use, but I hope to add
* more useful features that might benefit others :)

### What does sconelib contain? ###

* sconelib
	* TimedScene 		- An extension of HaxePunk's Scene class that adds functionality for a fixedUpdate,
	as well as the logic for calling fixedUpdate in any TimedEntities.
	* TimedEntity		- An extension of Haxepunk's Entity class that adds a fixedUpdate function, which
	is called on every tick, rather than every frame.
	* AngularMovement

	* sconelib.math
		* SconeMath 	- Most notable for having basic float and point approximation functions.
	* sconelib.time
