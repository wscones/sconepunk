### What is sconelib? ###

* Sconelib is a simple collection of utility classes that I frequently use for HaxePunk development.
* I've been wanting to collect them in a single library that I can collect them all in one spot so I
* don't have to search for every file and copy them over every time I want to use them :)
* 
* Version 0.0.1
